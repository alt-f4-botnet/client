**ALT-F4** is a **powerful botnet** connected to **several servers**. If you want **authkey** contact me on **discord** where my name is **Sparrow#3378**!


# Files

Everything you need to use the botnet, hereinafter referred to as a client, can be found here in this **repository + authkey**, which you can get after contacting me. There are a few files here, but the main one you will use is client.js. The client is connected to our main server, which is connected to several other servers on which our api is enabled 24/7. __Before using, please read the tos__, which you will find after opening the client and writing the tos. This Client is only under development, so there are several errors, such as the fact that it is not possible to go back to the menu. Don't worry, we are constantly working on everything.
